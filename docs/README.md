## Story and Setting Info


**Geography 101:** Due to the low population of Oregon in 1981, the Camarilla treats it like one big city.

Salem is the State Capitol, it is solidly Camarilla, and the sect has an iron grip on all the mechanisms of state government.  Any threat to this power is met with swift, harsh, violent retribution by the potent Elders who live there.  The only vampires allowed in Salem are the Prince, Seneschal, Primogen, Sheriff and those they designate, such as Abdal min Aldam.  Every time the Sabbat enter Salem, they are nearly immediately destroyed.  Astonishingly quickly, efficiently, and cleanly.

Portland is a mixed city consisting of a slight majority of Anarchs of varying power levels, a large minority of Camarilla ancillae, neonates and fledglings, and a small minority of Independents.  The dividing line between Camarilla and Anarch territory in Portland is the north-south running portion of the 99E, with the Camarilla on the west side, and it has been this way for quite some time, though, in practice, it is the Williamette River that is the dividing line.  Members of the Camarilla who haven’t been granted leave are generally only tolerated in Anarch territory if with an escort, tending to owned real estate, or passing through, and it helps to be on a highway or main road when using this last excuse.  The same is true for Anarchs in Camarilla territory with the above exceptions, although Anarchs are allowed access to Elysiums, and Salons if the host is so inclined.  The riverfront on both sides is shared, as are the many locations near it that can be considered “The Rack”.  The Seneschal visits on occasion, but the most visible part of Camarilla power here are the Whips, one for each Clan, who’re appointed by the Primogen via fiat.  Sabbat can be found scattered around the State, and at least one very stealthy pack operates here.  It is also a very badly kept secret that Astoria is held by the Sabbat in whole, very solidly.
