# The High Cost of Dying

*Assamite Contracts and Promotions in the World of Darkness (v3)*

## Generalities

The first thing to know is that Assamites all answer to Alamut, the Eagle’s Nest. All official contracts have to be approved by the ruling council there (the Silsila).

The second thing to know is that Assamites are Independent and everyone knows that, but that hardly makes them *authorized* to assassinate anyone (be they Camarilla, Anarch, Sabbat, Autarkis, something else). So they also have a vested interest in not having any given kill openly pinned to them (due to the Tradition of Destruction, or general politics of the not-assassinated taking the killing poorly for those Sects who don’t care about Traditions). Despite that they aren’t explicitly allowed to kill people for payment, they surely do, and it’s a definitely known thing that open reprisals against Assamites *on official Contracts* would draw direct attention and counter-reprisals from Alamut. It’s a delicate dance.

The third thing to know is that there are only two kinds of payments. For mortals it’s cash. LOTS of cash. For Kindred, it’s Vitae. And only Vitae. The payment required scales along with the implied strength/power of the target. Woe to those that claim the target is a Neonate, when they’re revealed to be a 500 year old city Primogen. Since all Contracts are through the Silsila, they know who to hunt down when this sort of thing happens. By Modern Nights this sort of thing almost never happens anymore, and they positively enjoy making examples out of people that try it. Paying the price gets you a dead target, or the assassin dies trying. If the assassin dies, the client does not get free retries.

The fourth thing to know is that Warriors carry out the bulk of the Contracts. Viziers and Sorcerers have other things they’re supposed to be doing. But, like the Army will tell you, at the end of the day all of them are Assamites. Which means ANY Caste can be called upon to fulfill a contract. Those with deep lore on the Clan will know that sometimes, the Silsila uses this fact to give suicidal contracts to those Assamites out of favor, or ones that Powers in the Clan would rather see dead. Sometimes this inadvertently leads to increased status for the assignee, as the bookish Vizier manages to pull off the impossible. Usually it results in the under-skilled assassin being destroyed themselves.

The final thing to know, is that there is Accounting at the Eagle’s Nest. Hidden in Alamut is the fabled Well, where there is rumored to be blood from Haqim himself. This also is the storehouse of the Clan’s wealth in blood, tithed from all of the Clan, and collected from the members who fall themselves. Each Clan member in good standing has a share of the Well, and when their share becomes large enough they may be promoted through the use of a rare, powerful Ritual. Or attempt the promotion at least.

## The Blood-Price

The Clan thrives on blood as currency for deeds dark (and sometimes for deeds less so). In times past, it was something other Clans didn’t understand. Why would those who can’t drink Vitae want to be paid in it? But the Clan had a secret: A ritual that could condense the essential power in Vitae, and provide Amaranth-like increase in raw power. Not the Disciplines, or the memories (or the incriminating aura alterations). But the Generation itself could be reduced to be closer to Caine himself. This was done not only to strengthen the Clan, but due to pressure from those on the Road of Blood to be able to perfect themselves despite the Curse levied on the Clan by the Tremere.

Any official assassination Contract with the Silsila will have a price in Vitae. Paid in advance. When the contract is sealed, the Clan is beholden to fulfil it. An Assamite is assigned, and they ***must*** complete it or die trying, though timing is not usually rigidly defined. Contracts against immensely powerful targets have taken years before the Assamite struck. And, sometimes, fell in the attempt. Should the assassin try and fail but survive, they’re required to keep trying until they succeed… or die. When the target falls, or the assassin falls, the contract is considered resolved.

> **The (minimum) Price is 13 points of Vitae, of the Generation of the target (or lower/stronger). 5 for the Pillars, 7 for the Sins to be cleansed, 1 for Haqim. This Vitae must retain all supernatural aspects, not be debased or degraded in any way. The Silsila receives 2 for the Tithe. The Sire receives one, in honor of raising a Childe to give back to the Clan. The Assassin receives the rest. But not until the Contract is completed and the target has died the Final Death. This is the base price, for an arbitrary Kindred of a given generation. For the powerful, the price goes up. Sometimes significantly.**
>
> **Take the highest ‘value’ of the target, in Status (or their value in the Mentor, Allies, or Contact dots to a PC. Divide that in half, rounding up. Add that as a multiplier (status 0 is 1x, status 1-2 is 2x, status 3-4 is 3x, status 5 is 4x). A wandering Gangrel is ‘cheap’. The Gangrel Justicar is extremely costly in blood, risk, and difficulty.**

There is ample magic involved, for the Clan’s Sorcerers have been tasked to empower the Mountain (and the Amrs through the ages are committed to breaking the Tremere curse).

First, each Assamite eligible to receive a Contract is issued a minor magical item. With it, the Vitae they collect is sent back to the Mountain, so it cannot be lost in the field. On the receiving end, sorcerous vessels preserve the vitae unaltered, and identify the Vitae as untampered with and of a certain strength (the Silsila knows what they get). The Vessels of Sacrament will not send mortal blood, nor will they send blood unusable by the Clan (for example, transformed to Scorpion’s Touch, or denatured by Tremere sorcery, or simply left out for too many hours).

Consider a Vessel of Sacrament to be a 2 dot magical Artifact that the Assamite does not have to pay for.

Assamite blood that is sent to Alamut will not officially add to the assassin's account, though the Clan always smiles on those who contribute to the Well for the Clan's overall prosperity and strength.

It should also be noted that an Assamite cannot pay for their own Contracts (or have those Bound to them pay the Blood Price) to justify a personal killing before or after the fact as an official 'job'. This is generally considered an affront to Clan honor. It’s also lazy. Own your actions, Children of Haqim.

Once the Payment is received, the Contract is sealed, and issued to an Assamite in the field. They are sent an enchanted note, a death mark if you like, that notes the target and that it is a true Contract. It can only be read by the assassin it is issued to, or a person the assassin designates as authorized. Once issued, a Contract cannot be canceled without death of the target, or a further blood-price. Calling a Contract off requires an additional 13 points of Vitae of the Generation of the assassin assigned to the Contract. In truth, this almost never happens. And has never happened twice by the same client.

## The Ascension

Every Assamite in good standing has an account, tied to the receiving side of their Vessel of Sacrament and their own Blood. While some of the newer Assamites may grumble under their breath that there are accounting irregularities and cheating by the Silsila, Elders will assure anyone who asks that these are petulant whining by the untalented.
Of course, many of those whiners receive Contracts far in excess of their skills if they make a nuisance of themselves.

When an Assamite has accrued enough Blood in the Well, they may request the attempt to Ascend and become closer to Haqim. The Clan itself will perform the Ritual: From Marduk’s Throat for the aspirant using Vitae from the Well. This brings those sending Vitae back to the Clan better Generation, more power, more effectively strengthening the Clan than any mere title or trinket.

As the Assamites performing Contracts will receive a variety of Generations of Vitae as payment, there is an exchange rate of sorts to enable them to benefit from work ‘beneath’ their current strength of blood so long as they stay in good standing with the Clan. For every 2 points of lesser blood, their account is credited with 1 point of the next Generation. They cannot use their own blood for their own account, ever.

* 2 points of 13th Generation Vitae counts as 1 point of 12th Generation.
* 2 points of 12th Generation counts as 1 point of 11th Generation, and so on.

Every point of blood stronger than they need is credited as ***2*** points of Vitae of the next weaker Generation.

* 1 point of 6th Generation Vitae counts as 2 points of 7th Generation Vitae, and so on.

For a casting of Marduk’s Throat, the aspirant needs four times the blood pool of the Generation they are Ascending to, in Vitae of that Generation, from two or more different vampires.

> ***Ex:*** A 13th Generation Assamite is Ascending to 12th Generation. 12th Generation has a maximum blood pool of 11. The Aspirant needs 44 points of 12th Generation Vitae in their account (or its equivalent, keeping in mind the “exchange rate”).

> ***Ex 2:*** An 8th Generation Assamite is Ascending to 7th Generation. The maximum blood pool is 20, so the Aspirant will need ***80*** points of 7th Generation Vitae. 8 kills of 7th Generation targets. 512 kills of 13th Generation.

Ascension to the heights is no small thing.

## False Prophets

For those not in good standing with the Clan, there is always learning the Ritual themselves. This, of course, works fine so long as you are capable of learning Assamite Sorcery (Dur An Ki) to 5, and finding or incepting the Ritual From Marduk’s Throat.

Should you achieve those two great things, be aware:

The Silsila does not like competition. The blood-thirsty Warriors there are very committed to keeping their power, and their choke-hold on the Clan. People other than them that can provide Ascension in Generation, without their approval and control, tend to lead very short careers and succumb rapidly to unfortunate accidents. Only the strongest (or most loyal) are allowed to learn the Ritual and not suffer for knowing it.

And more importantly: Doing it yourself, outside of the auspices and blessings of the Eagle’s Nest, means being unable to draw on the depth and diversity of the Well of Life in the Mountain.

Those casting the ritual must make the extract, the sludge, at a given Generation. That casting of the Ritual will require the full requisite amount of blood, of the correct Generation, with no substitutions.

A would-be caster of the Ritual intended to result in the Ascension to 7th Generation is going to have to have 80 points of 7th Generation Vitae on hand at the ritual site throughout the process. No exchange rate can apply.

With these things in mind, the ritual is cast as normal per standard rules. The resulting sludge will only last until sunrise, unless put into a container capable of stabilizing vitae (and even then will only last for a year and a day).

This sludge will, as stated in the Ritual, only raise a successful imbiber by a single Generation. At Storyteller option, attempting to imbibe a preparation created from ‘too strong’ Vitae (a 12th Gen Aspirant consuming the sludge of a 7th Gen ritual) **will** have side effects up to and included aggravated damage on failure, and will cause damage and possible side effects even on successful ingestion and assimilation.
