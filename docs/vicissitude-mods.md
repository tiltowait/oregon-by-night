# **Vicissitude Modifications**
*Thanks to Dr. Constantine for his assistance on this project.*

---

?> **Updated 11/26/21.** Everything new is <u>underlined</u>.

Although you may not be talented at the Tzimisce forms of Fleshcrafting and Bonecrafting, at some point you have been… modified into a more warlike form. Generally speaking, most modifications necessitate the purchase of the Flaw: Monstrous. As a rule, the Tzimisce make sufficient cosmetic alterations to ruin the looks of all their battle-ghouls, even those whose modifications are not in and of themselves hideous. Those Modifications that don’t NECESSITATE this Flaw all have Identical Sentences attached to them.

You may grant a number of Merit and Flaw points, not including Monstrous if required, equal to 7+(The Ability You’re Using for Your Pool Dots). Your body may only sustain 12 Points of total Modifications, not including Monstrous. The Recipient of your Modifications do not spend any XP to gain them, nor do they gain any Flaw points should they obtain such.

These modifications are permanent unless shaped away by further Vicissitude, or you are a vampire of equal or lower Generation than your Shaper. See the Core Mechanics for Details on Healing Vicissitude modifications.  Although dangerous, any weaponry causes Lethal damage only; despite its horrid appearance, your arsenal is still only mortal flesh and bone. You may purchase as many modifications as you can afford, but your social abilities are probably doomed.

Note: Ghouls may never heal Vicissitude modifications, not even with vampire blood. In this respect they are as helpless as mortals. The exceptions are ghouls who themselves possess Vicissitude, though a lowly Zantosa may well find herself helpless to repair the mutilation inflicted by a seventh-generation Tzimisce (to repair Vicissitude alterations, a ghoul must have a level of Vicissitude superior to that of the vampire who inflicted the mutilation).

?> **SYSTEM TO APPLY:** Roll your Vicissitude Pool, Difficulty is Equal to the Point Value of the Modificaiton and you must gain 2 or more Successes. Failure = Heal it, or try again. Botch = Aggravated wounds = to Botch Severity. These wounds may only be healed by a Shaper of equal or lower Generation, or, by the normal healing process but only if you are of an equal or lower Generation than your Shaper. Modifications take 2 hours per Point to apply. They must be applied in one “surgery” for lack of a better word.

## Common Knowledge
The modifications listed under the Merit ‘Vissicitude Modifications’ *(Ghouls and Revenants p134)* are known to you just for having Vicissitude. As are all the abilities and mechanics listed in the Core in the Disciplines Entry. All others must be researched, taught, discovered, etc. This will require Downtime to acquire.

### Circular Vision (1 pt)
One of your eyes has been moved to the back of your head, granting you the ability to see at a wider angle. You may gain a bonus to Perception, especially in cases when a character is attempting to sneak up on you. Additionally, your depth perception is poor at any angle, and you suffer a two die penalty to any rolls that involve gauging distance, including the use of projectile weapons.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 134)*
* *(Requires you to take the Monstrous Flaw)*

### Fangs (1 pt)
Your teeth have been lengthened and sharpened; your smile may resemble a tiger’s or a shark’s, or it may be unlike anything found in nature. You may attack using Bite, which is found on page 276 of V20. Due to your monstrous appearance, you will lose two dice in pools involving your Manipulation Attribute, unless you are trying to intimidate or scare your target. This modification can be explained away by mundane means, but imposes a +1 Difficulty on all Social Attribute based rolls.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 135)*
* *(Requires you to take the Monstrous Flaw)*

### Iron Stomach (2 pts)
You are able to digest any organic material that you can break up, chew, and swallow. On Stamina rolls, you gain a +2 when you need to resist ingested poisons or other types of stomach-based illnesses. This digestive modification is often paired with Fangs. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 135)*

### Spurs (2 pts)
Sharp, pointed bone spurs protrude from your forearms, spine, or calves. You may slash with your Spurs for Str + 2 damage. However, Spurs are hard to conceal and may limit your mobility in some instances.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 135)*

### Carapace (3 pts)
You are covered with bony or spiky plates that protect you from being attacked. You may add two soak dice to your pool when you are defending yourself from harm.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 135)*

### Patagia (4pts.)
Your bones have been hollowed and flaps of foreign skin have been grafted onto your arms and wrists to form membranes. While you cannot fly, you may use these bat-like wings to glide from one higher position to another, or to the ground. Subtract one die from all soak pools to resist strikes from fists and blunt weapons, or any other forms of concussive damage that might damage your bones.

* *(Ghouls and Revenants pg 135)*

## Canon Merits

### Bruiser (1 pt)
Your appearance is sufficiently thug-like to inspire fear (or at least disquiet) in those who see you. While you’re not necessarily ugly, you do radiate a quiet men-ace, to the point where people cross the street to avoid passing near you. All Intimidation rolls against those who have not demonstrated their physical superiority to you are at -1 difficulty. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 480)*

### Enchanting Voice (2pt)
There is something about your voice that others cannot ignore. When you command, they are cowed. When you seduce, they swoon. Whether thundering, soothing, persuading, or simply talking, your voice commands attention. The difficulties of all rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm, or command are reduced by two.  This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.
* *(V20 Core, pg 480)*

### Friendly Face (1 pt)
You have a face that reminds everyone of someone, to the point where strangers are inclined to be well-inclined toward you because of it. The effect doesn’t fade even if you explain the “mistake,” leaving you at -1 difficulty on all appropriate Social-based rolls (yes for Seduction, no for Intimidation, for example) when a stranger is involved. This Merit only functions on a first meeting. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 480)*

### Acute Senses (1 pt)
One of your senses is exceptionally sharp, be it sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste. The difficulties for all tasks involving the use of this particular sense are reduced by two. This Merit can be combined with the Discipline of Auspex to produce superhuman sensory acuity. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 480)*

### Heavy Hands (3 pt)
One of the effects of becoming a vampire is strange changes happening to your body. The obvious alterations to your hands have made them tougher, harder and more impervious to pain. All difficulties for damage rolls using unarmed attacks are reduced by one. Noticing this Merit is a “Spot Obvious” roll and should be declared in any scene where you’re not using supernatural powers to hide it. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Bloodlines pg 37)*

### Lizard Limbs (1 pt)
Like a lizard, you are able to actually shed parts of your body. By spending a blood point and a little effort, you can detach a hand or foot, or even an arm or leg. This might be to escape bonds or a grapple. Unfortunately, the appendage will not reattach, and you will have to regrow that over time (usually a couple of days for a hand or foot, and a week for a limb). You also suffer a -3 dice pool penalty to actions that would require the use of more limbs. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 160)*

### Long Fingers (1 pt)
You have been blessed with unusually long and graceful fingers. This means you have an easier time with fine manipulation as well as grappling tasks, gaining an extra die when attempting such actions.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 160)*

### Monstrous Maw (1 pt)
You have either over-sized tusks for fangs, or a huge mouth full of sharp teeth. Whatever form it takes, your mouth is that of a monster. When attacking with a bite you do an additional point of damage. You may also add a die to your Intimidation dice pool when you smile. This is separate from the other Merit of the same name.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 160)*

### Slimy (1 pt)
You secrete an ooze, which is as disgusting as it sounds. The ooze covers your entire body and soaks into your clothes. It makes you slippery and difficult to hold, requiring opponents to gain two more successes to grapple you. The dampness also makes you a little fire resistant, reducing your difficulty to soak fire damage by 1.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 160)*

### Bioluminescence (1 pt)
Perhaps through biological expertise, or perhaps by unlocking something primordial within, you have accessed the secrets of bioluminescence. Using the Vicissitude, you may grant yourself (through Malleable Visage) or others (via Fleshcraft — both as per V20, p. 241) the ability to emit a soft glow. With muscle control and practice, you can control the color and pattern of the illumination. This can light a soft glow in the dark, create beautiful displays, or even act as a primal form of communication. Some Fiends grant their ghouls or childer bioluminescence, developing an eerily nuanced and wordless language with their thralls and broods. Only characters with at least one dot of Vicissitude may purchase this Merit.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 238)*

### Pain Tolerance (2 pts)
Maybe you are a badass or shut off your nerves through Vicissitude. Maybe your sire put you through so many intricate hells that it would be tough for anyone else to compete. Maybe it just turns you on. Regardless, at Hurt or Injured, you suffer no wound penalties, though you still suffer full penalties at Wounded and below. You must have a Conviction or Courage rating of 3 or more to take this Merit. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 238)*

### Huge Size (4 pts)
You are abnormally large in size, at least 6’10” and 300 pounds in weight (well over two meters tall and over 130 kgs). Aside from making you extremely noticeable in public, this extra mass bestows an additional Bruised health level. Characters with this Merit may also gain bonuses to push objects, open barred doors, avoid being knocked down, etc. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 480)*

### Tough Hide (2pt. Merit)
Your skin is much tougher than usual, possibly like that of a rhino or a lizard. This hide protects you against most normal damage, granting you an extra die when making a soak roll. However, this bonus does not apply against fire and sunlight.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 160)*

### Dark Sight (2 pts)
 You are equipped with the Pits of Vipers, Compound Retinas or some such that allows you to see through mundane mist, smoke and total darkness. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Venue Modification)*

### Claws (1-3 pts):  
1 Point for Claws that turn your unarmed strikes into Lethal +1, additional points add 1 Lethal.  1 Point to Make them Retractable thus removing the Monstrous Flaw required for this modification only, this may only be done for 1 Point Claws.  The forgoing requires Malleable Visage to perform on the self, and Flesh Craft to perform on others.  Claws that inflict Lethal +3 Require Bonecraft, cannot be hidden, are a Breach of the Masquerade, and require you to take Monstrous.

* *(Venue Modification)*

### Additional Blood Pool (Variable)
Each point you put into this Modification grants you 1 Additional Blood Pool for vitae. For ghouls, each Additional Blood Pool costs 2 points. This reflects the need to worry about functional anatomy. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

### Relocated Heart (1 or 3)
This relocates your heart, for all the obvious reasons, to somewhere else in your body, you must declare on your sheet in a convenient place and upload it to the Staff upon your decision. This modification costs 1 point for Vampires, and 3 points for everything else. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Venue Modification)*

### Heart of Bone (1-5)
Your heart is protected by a sheath of cartilage and/or bone. Each level of this Modification grants an additional die to soak all attempts to pierce your heart. This includes but is not limited to staking and called combat shots. You must possess Bonecraft to grant the 4th and 5th levels of this Modification. Ghouls may only receive up to 2 levels in this Modification, and it costs them double. This reflects the need to compensate for functional biology. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Venue Modification)*

### Blush of Health (2pt. Merit)
You look more hale and healthy in appearance than other vampires, allowing you to blend with human society much more easily. You still retain the color of a living mortal, and your skin feels only slightly cool to the touch. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Eat Food (1pt. Merit)
You have the capacity to eat food and even savor its taste. While you cannot derive any nourishment from eating regular foods, this ability will serve you well in pretending to be human. Of course, you can’t digest what you eat, and there will be some point during the evening when you have to heave it back up. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Antitoxin Blood (1pt. Merit)
Although vampires are typically immune to mortal drugs and poisons, there are supernatural venoms that can affect Kindred physiology. A Ravnos with this Merit is immune to all forms of drugs and poisons, including the venoms and toxins of supernatural creatures or those created by supernatural powers. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 181)*

### Sturdy (4pt. Merit)
You gain an additional Bruised Health Level and all your Wound Penalties are reduced by 1 Die. This does not result in any outward physical transformation. This Merit costs double for Mortals and Ghouls. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence. This Merit is from Dark Ages, but is not cited here because of significant changes from the base system.

### <u>Alien Perfection (2)</u>
<u>You possess beauty unsettling in its perfection. People stand in awe of your flawless form, while inexplicable nausea subconsciously creeps up. The difficulty of any Appearance roll is reduced by three. A Stamina roll is required by anyone in your presence for longer than one scene, if this is the first time they’ve encountered you. Failure drives them away from you with a sickness wracking their body.  This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.</u>

* *(Lore of the Bloodlines p59)*

### <u>Drug Resistance (2)</u>
<u>You are unusually resistant to alcohol, narcotics, and similar addictive substances. You can pretend to be far more under the influence than you are in order to take advantage of an opponent. All rolls to resist the effects of such substances are at -2 difficulty.  This Modification cannot be granted to Vampires or any other undead.  This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.</u>

* *(Lore of the Clans p67)*

### <u>Disease Resistance (2)</u>
<u>You are unusually resistant to any and all infections by pathogens.  As well, you are able to fight off any and all other types of “diseases”, like cancer, Alzheimer's, Kuru, Lou Gherig’s, Epilepsy, etc, et al.  This does not extend to Derangements.  You can pretend to be far more under the influence than you are in order to take advantage of an opponent. All rolls to resist the effects of such things are at -2 difficulty.  This Modification cannot be granted to Vampires or any other undead.  This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.</u>

* *(Venue Modification)*

## Canon Flaws

### Hard of Hearing (1 pt)
Your hearing is defective. The difficulties of any rolls involving the use of hearing are increased by two. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Short (1 pt)
You are well below average height — four and a half feet (1.5 meters) tall or less. You have difficulty reach-ing or manipulating objects designed for normal adult size, and your running speed is one-half that of an aver-age human. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Tic/Twitch (1 pt)
You have some sort of repetitive motion that you make in times of stress, and it’s a dead giveaway as to your identity. Examples include a nervous cough, con-stantly wringing your hands, cracking your knuckles, and so on. It costs one Willpower to refrain from en-gaging in your tic. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Bad Sight (1 pt or 3 pts)
Your sight is defective. The difficulties of any die rolls involving the use of your eyesight are increased by two. As a one-point Flaw, this condition can be cor-rected with glasses or contacts; as a three-point Flaw, the condition is too severe to be corrected. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Unblinking (1 pt)
Your eyes do not close. Ever. Perhaps you have left your humanity too far behind to upkeep such habits, or perhaps you fleshcrafted some form of transparent eye-scale or nictitating membrane. Your quirk probably makes astute observers uncomfortable, adding +1 to the difficulty of friendly social interactions with humans, Kindred on Humanity, and others with mortal sensibilities. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 239)*

### Disfigured (2 pts)
A hideous disfigurement makes your appearance dis-turbing and memorable. The difficulties of all die rolls relating to social interaction are increased by two. You may not have an Appearance rating greater than 2. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### One Eye (2 pts)
You have only one eye — which eye is missing is up to you. The difficulties of all Perception rolls involving eyesight are increased by two, and the difficulties of all die rolls requiring depth perception are increased by one (this includes ranged combat). This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Venomous Bite (2 pts)
You have developed venom glands in the roof of your mouth. The venom is a virulent neurotoxin, fatal to mortals, although Kindred and other supernatural creatures are unaffected by it. You, of course, are immune. The problem is you have no control over your poison glands. When you bite, you always inject this venom, usually killing your human victims. You must learn to feed in other ways, perhaps drawing the blood you need with a syringe or razor, if you do not wish to kill every time you feed. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 67)*

### Forked Tongue (2 pts)
Your tongue is forked, flickering, and inhumanly reptilian. Upholding the Masquerade becomes difficult for you. Note that this tongue does not inflict aggravated damage, nor draw blood.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 67)*

### Deformity (3 pts)
You have some kind of deformity — a misshapen limb, hunchback, or clubfoot, for example — which affects your physical abilities and interactions with others. A hunchback, for instance, would lower a char-acter’s Dexterity by two dots and increase the difficulty of die rolls relating to social skills by one. It is the re-sponsibility of the Storyteller to determine the specific effects of the deformity chosen. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Lame (3 pts)
Your legs are damaged, which prevents you from run-ning or walking easily. You are forced to walk with a cane or possibly leg braces, and you have a pronounced limp to your stride. Your walking speed is one-quarter that of a normal human, and running is impossible. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Monstrous (3 pts)
Your physical form was twisted during the Embrace, and now reflects the Beast that rages inside you. Characters with this Flaw appear to be savage monsters and have Appearance ratings of zero. Nosferatu and other bloodlines whose weaknesses cause them to start off with Appearance zero cannot take this Flaw.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Bestial (3 pts)
You are closer to animals than humans, and it shows. In addition to the Nosferatu Clan weakness, you have an additional weakness: whenever you frenzy, you gain an animal feature, similar to the Gangrel Clan weakness (V20, p. 55). With Storyteller permission, permanently acquired animal features may be justification to acquire certain Merits after character creation, such as Lizard Limbs (p. 160) or Monstrous Maw (pp. 160-161). If so, the Storyteller can simply award them, or require an experience point expenditure (such as two times the Merit point value). Similar Flaws can also be taken, but cannot grant additional freebie or experience points. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 163)*

### Deaf (4 pts)
You cannot hear. While you may be more resistant to some applications of Dominate, you also may not listen to electronic or vocal media, and the difficulties of many Perception rolls are increased by three.  This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Mute (4 pts)
You cannot speak. You may communicate with the Storyteller and describe your actions, but cannot talk to player or Storyteller characters unless everyone concerned purchases a commonly understood sign language (via the Language Merit) or you write down what you wish to say. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Blind (6 pt Flaw)
You cannot see. Characters can compensate for the loss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them. Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex 2) are still able to use this ability, thought the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the other hand, vampires who need make eye contact to enact powers like Dominate against you are only at a penalty to do so (see the sidebar on p. 152). This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Smell of the Grave (1 pt Flaw)
You exude an odor of dampness and newly turned earth, which no amount of scents or perfumes will cover. Mortals in your immediate presence become uncomfortable, so the difficulties of all Social rolls to affect mortals increase by one. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 481)*

### Infectious Bite (2pt. Flaw)
You may not automatically lick the wounds of your feeding closed. In fact, your bites have a one in five chance of becoming infected and causing mortal vic-tims to become seriously ill. The precise nature of the infection is determined by the Storyteller. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Glowing Eyes (3pt. Flaw)
You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampire legend, which gives you a -1 difficulty on Intimidation rolls when you’re dealing with mortals. However, the tradeoffs are many; you must constantly disguise your condition (no, contacts don’t cut it); the glow impairs your vision and puts you at +1 difficulty on all sight-based rolls (including the use of ranged weapons); and the radiance emanating from your eye sockets makes it difficult to hide (+2 difficulty to Stealth rolls) in the dark.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Permanent Fangs (3pt. Flaw)
Your fangs do not retract, making it impossible for you to hide your true nature. While some mortals may think you’ve had your teeth filed or are wearing pros-thetics, sooner or later you’re going to run into some-one who knows what you truly are. You are also limited to a maximum Appearance rating of 3. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Core Rulebook pg 482)*

### Stench (1pt. Flaw)
Most Nosferatu pick up a certain odor, but you stink so bad even your Clan-mates find you hard to be close to. Your presence is preceded by your stench, removing two die from all Stealth rolls, except while under supernatural powers that hide such things. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.

* *(Lore of the Clans pg 161)*

### Contagious (5pt. Flaw)
Your body has died on the inside, filling you with noxious bacteria, spores, and even fungi. Mortals that touch you or on whom you feed must make a Stamina roll (difficulty 9) not to fall ill. The illness puts them in bed with fever and sickness, and each week they may attempt the Stamina roll again. The Storyteller might reduce the difficulty if the target is receiving proper medical attention. On a success they recover, but if they fail, they remain feverish. At the end of each month the victim remains ill, they lose a point of Stamina; if they are reduced to zero Stamina they die. If the Nosferatu knows of their contagion and infects someone maliciously, the Storyteller might call for a Humanity (or appropriate Path of Morality) degeneration roll if they die. Supernatural creatures generally have the ability to heal or cure such sickness in themselves, and vampires are immune to these germs of the dead. This does not require you to take Monstrous if it stands alone or with other Modifications that bear this sentence.
